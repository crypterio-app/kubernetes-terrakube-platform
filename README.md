## Terraform Module - Terrakube | Kubernetes
Terrakube is an open source collaboration platform for running remote infrastructure as code operations using Terraform or OpenTofu that aims to be a complete replacement for close source tools like Terraform Enterprise, Scalr or Env0.

The platform can be easily installed in any kubernetes cluster, you can easily customize the platform using other open source tools already available for terraform (Example: terratag, infracost, terrascan, etc) and you can integrate the tool with different authentication providers like Azure Active Directory, Google Cloud Identity, Github, Gitlab or any other provider supported by Dex.
